# discouse-tools

This project is simply a collection of various tools that I use with my discourse server.  There is nothing terribly
there is nothing terribly special about them other than the fact that I figured someone else might find them useful in 
some way.  The codes is badly commented and I'm horribly and documenting.

I also don't pretend that this is the best way to do these things, I use python a lot because I know it and it is
fairly easy for me to code in, thus that's what I use.  Please feel free to use what you find here or not.
